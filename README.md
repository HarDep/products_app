## Credits

### App design credits

The original app design was by [Mao Lop](https://dribbble.com/m4st3rmiau), I have made app's UI based on the design of the [Delivery app](https://dribbble.com/shots/14173151-Delivery-app) by  Mao Lop, plus some small changes I have made to the original design.

### Some app widgets

I have based some of the app elements such as some of the use of some providers, interfaces and widgets on the content created by [diegoveloper](https://www.youtube.com/@diegoveloper), in his [Full Delivery App](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS57q8gZKG9apnFaI4jZqU8Mjs-od9s8) list.
